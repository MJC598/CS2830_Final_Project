    While I am majoring in Computer Science, my life doesn't necessarily revolve around it. I have two dogs at home I love very much, I enjoy my time at Mizzou, and I love the theater, both stage and cinema.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dogs have gotten me through some rough times from my grandpa's death to leaving my beloved high school. They mean the world to me and everytime I get to go home to see them I feel a little more complete. My older one, Murphy, is an Australian-Shepard/Lab mix and approaching 13 years old. He loves lounging around and bothering his sister, Bell. She is a Beagle/bird dog mix and will cause all sorts of trouble. The thing is she is also a huge cuddler so she knows how to get away with stuff. When they run around and play together it's so funny because even though Murphy is twice her size she seems to think she is in charge. I really love them both, and they are the reason I love to help other animals like on my MAB service trip I talk about in my projects category.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mizzou is my home away from home. It is where all of my new friends are, it is where I study, where I sleep, and where I work. All of my projects are here and this is where I feel like I can grow. While here, I am majoring Computer Science and minoring in Political Science and Math and have enjoyed nearly every class I've taken. Already done with my sophomore year time is flying and I half expect to be graduating within a week.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm extremely disappointed I didn't discover the magic of the theater till my sophomore year of high school. That's when I took a chance and ran the follow spot for the school production of 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. It was so much fun and I formed such good lifelong relationships. From there I went on to work tech for the remaining six shows at my high school through junior and senior year including stage managing Almost Maine and Monty Python's Spamalot. Each one was extremely unique and made a huge impact on me. I wish I could work tech while here at Mizzou but unfortunately my schedule doesn't allow for it, so I'm stuck simply watching shows from the house. While still fun, it feels like something is missing and I still find myself looking back up into tech booths to watch the people work. I always have loved the behind-the-scenes stuff.
